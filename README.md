# Collab Fund Portfolio AI: OpenAI's Realtime API + LiveKit Integration

CollabFund Portfolio AI is a voice agent that combines web scraping, LLM analysis, and real-time voice interaction to analyze CollabFund's investment portfolio. Using OpenAI's Realtime API and LiveKit's real-time communication infrastructure, it provides deep insights into portfolio companies, market trends, and investment patterns. Users can explore investment styles, company defensibility, fundraising activities, and portfolio comparisons through natural conversation.

This is a local development project. Follow the setup guide below to run your own instance.

source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Configure agent (this file is git-ignored for security)
cp .env.sample .env

```
Add to your `.env`:

```python
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_livekit_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_livekit_api_secret

## Usage

With all components running, you can engage in natural conversations about the portfolio. Example queries:

Investment Analysis:
- "Which companies align best with Collaborative Fund's investment style?"
- "Can you tell me about three deep tech companies in our portfolio that have a consumer focus that we're very excited about?"
- "Can you tell me which three companies in our portfolio have the highest capital intensity and also give me a very brief description of what they do and their defensibility?"
- "Please identify the 5 companies that are least compatible or aligned with the Collaborative Fund investment style but which have an excitement score of 7 or greater."

Company Deep Dives:
- "Tell me about Impossible Foods' defensibility and barriers to entry."
- "What is The Browser Company's most recent valuation?"
- "Which companies have the highest capital intensity?"

Portfolio Insights:
- "Which climate companies raised the most money in the last 2 years?"
- "Could you please give me the three most recent news articles about AMP Robotics? Donâ€™t read the URLs."

Note: it's helpful to guide the speaking style of the agent by saying things like "In very brief, natural speech..." or "In one sentence..." or add "in brief terms" as the agent defaults to returning all available information for whatever field you're asking about.

## Deployment

- Agent: See [Deployment & Scaling Guide](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/deployment/)
- Frontend: Deploy using Next.js hosting solutions like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Troubleshooting

Verify that:
1. All environment files are properly configured
2. Portfolio data generation completed successfully
3. Agent is running and connected
4. Web server is active
5. Python 3.9+ and pnpm are installed correctly
